201 Final Project. Beer Selector. 

## Problem Domain

Here in Bend, Oregon we have an over-saturated craft beer market. Beer makers have begun splitting hairs of beer classifications and 'pushing' the definition of a product that's been around forever. Bend Beer Match seeks to find the beer-signal in a world of beer-noise. Supplying some basic attributes of beer you enjoy, Bend Beer Match will make choosing a beer a simple experience.
